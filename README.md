## Installation

Boilerplate example for a NodeJs application with Typescript. It also has eslint and prettier configured.

Before starting application you need to have installed: 
- [node](https://nodejs.org/uk/) 
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or
- [npm] (comes with node)

After yarn is installed, run 

```yarn```

to install app dependencies.

To start local server and generate the schema (once) open the shell as admin and run:
 
```yarn start```
